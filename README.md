# TrueUp-Glide-Mod

This is a modification of the [TrueUp Glide](http://www.openbuilds.com/builds/trueup-glide.3938/) 3D printer design by [Keith Davis](http://www.openbuilds.com/members/keith-davis.246/).

This mod differs from the source build in the following respects:

- Utilizes the [Bondtech BMG Extruder](http://shop.bondtech.se/ec/extruders/bmg-extruder.html) module
- Incorporates a [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) running [OctoPi](https://octopi.octoprint.org) into the control box
- Includes an optional printed enclosure for the power supply unit
- Consolidates several printed parts and introduces several new ones
- Utilizes heat-set threaded inserts in several instances
- Minor redesign and dimensional cleanup of most printed parts
- Dimensionally accurate and logically organized master SketchUp file

This build is currently a work-in-progress and has not yet been fully tested. The complete BOM will be added in spreadsheet form as soon as possible.
